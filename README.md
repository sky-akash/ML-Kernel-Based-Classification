# End of Course Project For Machine Learning

The project incldues development, implementation, and evaluation of several machine learning algorithms for classification task using a dataset with numerical features and labels. The goal is to explore and apply both linear and kernelized models to classify the data while focusing on improving model performance and evaluating the results with zero-one loss function.
